<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you how the personal
information you provide to this website is used, and what protections
of your privacy are in place. This policy is written in a way that's
intended to be easily understandable so that you can know if you are
comfortable with how this website uses your personal data.<br>

<br>

The effective version of this Privacy Policy is always the latest
version. This Privacy Policy was last updated April 23rd, 2012.<br>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

This website is a social-networking website. Thus, by its nature you
will be placing personal content on the website. Any content that you
place on the website is your choice.<br>

<br>

Also, some information is collected from you when you sign up to use
the website. This includes a name, an email address, and a password.
You do not have to provide your legal name. You must
provide a real email address--if you don't provide a real
email address you won't receive the sign-up email with your initial password.<br>

<br>

Additionally, some information about the computer you sign up from
(including the IP address you used) is collected when you sign up.<br>

<br>

When you use the website, all of your activity may be logged. This
includes (but isn't necessarily limited to) your IP address, what pages
you view, when you sign in and when you log out. <br>

<br>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

Diaspora uses cookies to remember who you are.<br>

<br>

<h3>How Your Information Is Used</h3>

Note that all the information collected about you by this website is
accessible to the operator of the website. The operator will try to
protect your privacy, but may come across some of your personal
information during operation and maintenance of the website.<br>

<br>

The main purpose of the information you post is to show it to others.
So, the website will show the information that you post to the people
you specify.<br>

<br>

Your sign-in information is used to try to keep unauthorized people
from accessing your data and posing as you.<br>

<br>

The sign-up and log information is used for system maintenance and
troubleshooting. It may also be used in case of fraudulant activity
(e.g. as part of an investigation if someone "hacks," or more properly,
"cracks" into the website).<br>

<br>

Any or all of your information may be stored in backups that are made
for the website.<br>

<br>

Be aware that since this website operates in the U.S., it is subject to
the Patriot Act, in addition to the rest of U.S. law. It is possible
that any of your personal information may be shared with law
enforcement. In particular, the Patriot Act may empower law enforcement
workers to request information without a court warrant and bar the
operator from informing the person whose information was shared. That's
an unfortunate reality. If you are unhappy about it, please let your
Congressmen know.<br>

<br>

<h3>Protecting Your Privacy</h3>

This website tries to be a privacy-friendly social network. Your
information is not sold to others, and the website is designed to try
to prevent access to your data that you don't allow. However, the
website may have bugs. Some of those bugs may allow access
to your data in ways that you didn't intend or desire.<br>

<br>

The operator has instituted controls to try to ensure your information
is kept private, including disk encryption, secure communication over
HTTPS, and firewalls. However, the operator makes no claim to being an
expert at Internet security and cannot guarantee that there isn't a
hole in the security. Additionally, understand that even the very best
security can be compromised.<br>

<br>

The website sends out email notifications of different activities on
the website. You cannot prevent the emails from being sent (when you comment, or
like a post, etc.).<br>

<br>

Be aware that anything you post as "Public" is visible to the entire
Internet.<br>

<br>

<h3>Third-party Websites</h3>

If you connect to any third-party websites (like Facebook or Twitter,
for example), they will have access to the information that you post on
that connection. Any such information is controlled by the Privacy
Policy of the website you connect to.<br>

<br>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>

You may contact the operator of the website at: windforest AT q
DOT com.<br>
